## Overview

I want to become a great and even better front end engineer so I'm going to keep building. Inspired by a really nice dev I met. 

Time to create: 6 hours 17 mins.

In the video, I go from a single screenshot and create-react-app (read: from nothing!) to an initial component-based implementation in React.

Structure of UI
* Left Column
  * Logo
  * Titles
  * Premium Section
  
* Right Column
  * Navigation
  * Activity
  * Daily Revenue + Support Center
  * Appointments + Team

Tech Used
* React
* React Feathers
* vx / d3 (Attempted)

Learnings
* Passing props through Styled Components
* My life is so much easier because of it. 

Improvements
* Not copy paste
* A better way on how to pass prop through components.
* Clean up my files at the end (too tired to do atm)
* Could use Figma more for the CSS coding
* Need to reduce the amount of time I am using justifyContent, alignItems and display: flex,
