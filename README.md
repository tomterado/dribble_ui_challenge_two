## Overview

I want to become a great and even better front end engineer so I'm going to keep building. This is a simple landing page I saw on Dribble today. Inspired by a really nice dev I met. 

Time to create: 1 hour 30 mins.

In the video, I go from a single screenshot and create-react-app (read: from nothing!) to an initial component-based implementation in React.
